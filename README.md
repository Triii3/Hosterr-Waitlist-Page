# Hosterr-Waitlist-Page challenge from codewell
This is my second take on the Hosterr Waitlist Page challenge from CodeWell. 
The first time I tried it was when I was fresh after studying HTML and CSS online. 
So after other projects, I decided to try this one out again, and I felt that I did it a lot better.


If there are any feedbacks on how I can better improve my coding feel free to leave some so I can further improve my capabilities!


Here are the reference designs of the HTML CSS Project!
